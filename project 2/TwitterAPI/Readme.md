# Twitter API
The Twitter API is a set of programmatic endpoints that can be used to learn from and engage with the conversation on Twitter. This API allows us to find and retrieve, engage with, or create a variety of different resources including the following: Tweets. Users. Direct Messages.
Twitter is one of the best places for text analyzing. In twitter everybody can specify their thought about specific topics and invite other friend to mention their opinion and ideas too. But in this area mentioning different and bad information is common. So, use of AI for classification of different opinion and labeling them is very important here. One of the most usable features for twitter is that it able us to downloading last number of tweets and analyses them. 
In our case we have used twitter API for reaching to specific number of tweets and use them as input dataset. Using of AI for classification is not something old. In this part we have used Natural Language Processing (NLP) for extracting useful information from text and classify them. The result of our work has shown in figure1.
